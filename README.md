Our project is intended to simulate a slimmed-down dungeon crawl video game, with the main gimmick being the ability to combine spells. To run it, you need to run the exe file.  In the game, by following the prompts provided in the console, you can battle through hoards of monsters using your unique abilities. Combining spells comes with a consequence, however. When you combine spells, it weakens each one individually, making them best suited for dealing with a diverse array of enemies. Additionally, all of your spells are area-of-effect, and enemies can only be defeated by fully weakening them.
